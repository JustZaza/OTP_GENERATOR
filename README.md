# 🔐 OTP Generator – Java Console App

## 📘 Project Description

This is a simple Java console application that generates a **4-digit numeric One-Time Password (OTP)** using random number generation. OTPs are commonly used in two-factor authentication (2FA), password resets, and identity verification systems.

The goal of this project is to practice:
- Basic Java syntax
- Random number generation
- String formatting and logic

---

## 🎯 Features

- Generates a **random 4-digit OTP** each time the program runs.
- Ensures the OTP is always exactly 4 digits (e.g., `0429`, `8392`, `0071`).
- Easy to read and reuse in security-related Java projects.
